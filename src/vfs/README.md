QVFS is a module that creates a virtual filesystem inside the webview that intercepts asset requests and serves them from embedded data, eliminating the need for network access or disk I/O.

- **Transparent Operation**: Works with standard HTML/CSS without changes.
- **Zero Network Dependency**: All assets are loaded from in-memory blobs.
- **Immutable by Design**: Assets can't be lost or modified after building the application.

### Runtime Virtual Filesystem

QVFS injects a global object at runtime, `window.__QUARK_VFS__`, containing all your assets as base64 data.

### Transparent Asset Interception

Overrides webview APIs to intercept asset requests and serve from the virtual filesystem instead.
